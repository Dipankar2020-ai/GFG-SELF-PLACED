Given a temperature in celsius C. You need to convert the given temperature to Fahrenheit.

Example 1:

Input:
C = 32
Output: 89
Explanation: Using the conversion 
formula of celsius to farhenheit , it
can be calculated that, for 32 degree
C, the temperature in Fahrenheit = 89.
Example 2:

Input:
50
Output: 122
Explanation: Using the conversion 
formulaof celsius to farhenheit, it
can be calculated that, for 50 degree
C, the temperature in Fahrenheit = 122.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function CtoF() that takes C as parameter and returns temperature in fahrenheit( in double). The flooring and printing is automatically done by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

solution:
class Solution{
    public:
    
    //You need to complete this function
    double cToF(int C)
    {
        double F=1.8*C+32;
        return F;
    }
};
